The government had charged that, despite having knowledge that the two drugs did not meet required specifications, Ethex violated the law by intentionally withholding this information from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Given the seriousness of Ethex\\'s conduct and the risk it posed to consumers of its drugs, the Justice Department pursued felony charges. According to charges presented in U.S. District Court in St. Louis, Ethex failed to submit required \"field alert reports\" to the FDA in 2008 concerning two drugs, propafenone and dextroamphetamine sulfate.  Following the recommendations of a plea agreement, Judge E. Richard Webber sentenced Ethex to pay a fine of more than $23.4 million, pay approximately $2.3 million in restitution to Medicare and Medicaid for their approximate losses, and forfeit nearly $1.8 million to the United States.',\n  'federal',\n  'agency action',\n  'Food and Drug Administration referral to the Justice Department',\n  'criminal',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '',\n  'USA',\n  'Missouri',\n  'out of business',\n  '',\n  'pharmaceuticals',\n  'pharmaceuticals',\n  'http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/kv-pharmaceutical-subsidiary-pleads-guilty-two-felonies-regarding-oversized-drugs',\n  ''],\n ['ExecuPharm, Inc.',\n  'Parexel International',\n  '$5,900',\n  '$0',\n  '$5,900',\n  '2017',\n  '20170401',\n  'employment-related offenses',\n  'Family and Medical Leave Act',\n  '',\n  '',\n  'federal',\n  'agency action',\n  'Labor Department Wage and Hour Division',\n  'civil',\n  '',\n  '',\n  '1808162',\n  '',\n  '',\n  'Pennsylvania',\n  'King of Prussia',\n  '610 Freedom Business Center Suite 200',\n  '19406',\n  '',\n  '',\n  'USA',\n  'Massachusetts',\n  'privately held',\n  '',\n  'pharmaceuticals',\n  'pharmaceuticals',\n  'July 23, 2017 download of a dataset posted by the Wage and Hour Division at https://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_summary.php',\n  'Date and year are the Findings End Date in the dataset posted by the Wage and Hour Division, which does not provide case opening or closing dates.
